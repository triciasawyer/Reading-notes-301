# Reading notes for class 14

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

**What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
When personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
Because in the 80's, when teaching computer science, professors had an expectation that everyone should know this sortof base knowledge, and if you didn't know those things that were expected, you were sort of dismissed.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**
When they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders, and meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**
Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
An example is when YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
