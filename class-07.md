## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

**What is node.js?**
It is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.

**In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**
Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. Chrome V8, or just V8, can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.

**What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**
Where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8.

**What is npm?**
Npm stands for Node Package Manager. It's a library and registry for JavaScript software packages. npm also has command-line tools to help you install the different packages and manage their dependencies.

**What version of node are you running on your machine?**
v19.7.0

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
9.5.0

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**
npm install jshint, then you can run npm -v to check and see if it installed and what version you installed.

**What is node used for?**
 Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**
Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work environment readiness.

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
Engaged collaboration.

**How does pair programming work?**
Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
